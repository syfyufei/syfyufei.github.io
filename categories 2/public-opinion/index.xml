      <title>Political Communication</title>

      <description>People do not merely respond to the outside world; they recognize, process, and make choices. I am interested in how this psychological process is achieved within media interactions among the sender, carrier, and receiver. This also makes my research different from the prevalent political-communication studies that focus on the content and means of the media. Instead, I focus more on how people respond to them, for instance, what the audience actually feels, understands, and does when they are exposed to a political message from the government.</description>

      <description>Socioeconomic inequality includes systematic discrepancies among citizens in income, assets, mobility, accessible resources, etc. I am interested in this structural property&amp;rsquo;s effects, paths, and mechanisms on individual and group political decisions and behaviors. In particular, how do people recognize inequality (what aspects of inequality)? How does their awareness and understanding of inequality affect their political cognition, preferences, and decisions? Even more interestingly, what (or&amp;hellip;who) forms the masses&amp;rsquo; inequality perceptions?
