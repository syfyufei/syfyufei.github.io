      <description>Disproportionate scholarly attention in the studies of the government-mass relationship focused on the government&amp;rsquo;s responses (motivations and means) to public demands. Less research explores what happens next. However, in real politics, the governments often fall into the curse that what they do mismatches what the public wants. I unbox this puzzle by investigating how the public responds to the government&amp;rsquo;s response. Several focused questions include: what do the masses learn from the government&amp;rsquo;s decisions and actions?</description>
