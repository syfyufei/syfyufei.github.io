      <description>In studies of official political discourse in non-Western electoral democracies, scholars have focused disproportionately on government discourse itself. Less research explores what happens next.
However, in real politics, the governments often fall into the curse that official discourse is unacceptable, ironic (KUSO), or misused by the public.
