      <description>Urban citizens are not only the demographic distributions in urban areas or objects ruled by the urban governments but active participants of urban governance and leading constructors of the state-society relationship. If regarding government policies as the responses of the public demands, I am interested in the responses of citizens with heterogeneous identities to these responses. Furthermore, I would like to evaluate the efficiency of the same policy tools on different groups of citizens in different types of cities.</description>
