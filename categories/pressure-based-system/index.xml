      <title>Local Governance in China</title>

      <description>The top-down pattern of political pressure transmission in China is often described as a &amp;ldquo;pressure-based system&amp;rdquo;. I am concerned about how local governments in China (especially at the prefectural level) can retain their autonomy in governance under such a repressive system. And, where does this autonomy come from? Economy? History? The social networks of leaders? I am particularly interested in the impact of local government capacity on their autonomy.</description>
