      <description>People do not merely respond to the outside world; they recognize, process, and make choices. I am interested in how this psychological process is achieved within media interactions among the sender, carrier, and receiver. This also makes my research different from the prevalent political-communication studies that focus on the content and means of the media. Instead, I focus more on how people respond to them, for instance, what the audience actually feels, understands, and does when they are exposed to a political message from the government.</description>

      <description>In studies of official political discourse in non-Western electoral democracies, scholars have focused disproportionately on government discourse itself. Less research explores what happens next.
However, in real politics, the governments often fall into the curse that official discourse is unacceptable, ironic (KUSO), or misused by the public.
I unbox this puzzle by investigating how the public responds to the government officail discourse. Several focused questions include: How do official forms of government discourse (the &amp;ldquo;official voice&amp;rdquo;) spread through different levels of government?</description>
