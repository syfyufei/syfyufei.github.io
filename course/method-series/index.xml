      <description>I created the &amp;ldquo;Learning R with Dr. Hu and His Friends&amp;rdquo; workshop series to help students without programming background to enjoy the convenience and efficiency programming (esp. based on R) can brings to their academic lives. The workshop series include 18 episodes that covers topics from fundamental data cleaning to Bayesian analysis and machine learning. This is a year-long program and free to access by all the Tsinghua community offline and others online.</description>
