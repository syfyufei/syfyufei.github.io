      <description>Analysis of Public Policy: Perspectives and Methods focuses on empirical policy evaluation. The course introduces a political scientist view and a series of modern empirical methods into public policy analyses. Students will learn not only the fundamental analytic theories for public policy evaluation but also tools such as case study, survey, experiments, and big-data analysis, that can be used to analyze different types of policies. In every topic, we will include real-life cases to illustrate how the theories and method can be applied.</description>

      <description>Policies are everywhere in the modern society. They serve as the tie between the rulers and ruled and the means to steer collective actions for the given goals. In this sense, the ability to understand where policy comes from and how it runs and ends has become a crucial quality of the potential successors and leaders. Understanding Public Policies: Interdisciplinary Perspectives and Case Illustrations is the place you cultivate this quality.</description>

      <title>Local Governance in China</title>

      <description>The top-down pattern of political pressure transmission in China is often described as a &amp;ldquo;pressure-based system&amp;rdquo;. I am concerned about how local governments in China (especially at the prefectural level) can retain their autonomy in governance under such a repressive system. And, where does this autonomy come from? Economy? History? The social networks of leaders? I am particularly interested in the impact of local government capacity on their autonomy.</description>

      <description>People do not merely respond to the outside world; they recognize, process, and make choices. I am interested in how this psychological process is achieved within media interactions among the sender, carrier, and receiver. This also makes my research different from the prevalent political-communication studies that focus on the content and means of the media. Instead, I focus more on how people respond to them, for instance, what the audience actually feels, understands, and does when they are exposed to a political message from the government.</description>

      <title>Political Discourse</title>

      <description>In studies of official political discourse in non-Western electoral democracies, scholars have focused disproportionately on government discourse itself. Less research explores what happens next.
However, in real politics, the governments often fall into the curse that official discourse is unacceptable, ironic (KUSO), or misused by the public.
I unbox this puzzle by investigating how the public responds to the government officail discourse. Several focused questions include: How do official forms of government discourse (the &amp;ldquo;official voice&amp;rdquo;) spread through different levels of government?</description>

      <description>Socioeconomic inequality includes systematic discrepancies among citizens in income, assets, mobility, accessible resources, etc. I am interested in this structural property&amp;rsquo;s effects, paths, and mechanisms on individual and group political decisions and behaviors. In particular, how do people recognize inequality (what aspects of inequality)? How does their awareness and understanding of inequality affect their political cognition, preferences, and decisions? Even more interestingly, what (or&amp;hellip;who) forms the masses&amp;rsquo; inequality perceptions?</description>

      <description>Language is the fundamental feature of human beings. The debate of whether does language shapes thoughts or the other way around has inspires the greatest theorists and scientists throughout the human history. Nevertheless, the importance of language in political lives has not been well studied yet.
Cutting in from an empirical angle, I strive to identify the influences of linguistic relativity and language planning in the government-mass relationship and the (re)construction of mass political cognition.</description>
