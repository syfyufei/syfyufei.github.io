      <description>Analysis of political data is a gateway course of political methodology and is compulsory for students in Political Science. The course introduces students to statistical and econometric knowledge for the analysis of quantitative data and provides a basis for more advanced statistical methods. After covering the fundamental concepts of statistics, such as probability and distributions, we will explore the classical normal linear regression model and its assumptions. We will also discuss the consequences and remedies for violations of these assumptions, including omitted variables, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, and endogeneity.</description>

      <description>Analysis of Public Policy: Perspectives and Methods focuses on empirical policy evaluation. The course introduces a political scientist view and a series of modern empirical methods into public policy analyses. Students will learn not only the fundamental analytic theories for public policy evaluation but also tools such as case study, survey, experiments, and big-data analysis, that can be used to analyze different types of policies. In every topic, we will include real-life cases to illustrate how the theories and method can be applied.</description>

      <description>Policies are everywhere in the modern society. They serve as the tie between the rulers and ruled and the means to steer collective actions for the given goals. In this sense, the ability to understand where policy comes from and how it runs and ends has become a crucial quality of the potential successors and leaders. Understanding Public Policies: Interdisciplinary Perspectives and Case Illustrations is the place you cultivate this quality.</description>

      <description>I created the &amp;ldquo;Learning R with Dr. Hu and His Friends&amp;rdquo; workshop series to help students without programming background to enjoy the convenience and efficiency programming (esp. based on R) can brings to their academic lives. The workshop series include 18 episodes that covers topics from fundamental data cleaning to Bayesian analysis and machine learning. This is a year-long program and free to access by all the Tsinghua community offline and others online.</description>

      <description>Course about how to use big data to investigate governance issues. This is an advanced method course. Recommend students who already finished Analysis of Political Data (70700173) or basic statistics/econometric to take. I co-instructed the course with Dr. MENG Tianguang. The following list are the lectures I usually give for this course:
 Research Principles and Method Basis for Big Data Analysis Leading the Focus: Data Visualization Latent Variable Basic Latent Variable Advanced Duration Analysis Foundations of Text Analysis Text Analysis in Practice Network Analysis: A Methodological Shift Network Analysis: Ego and Complete Network Analysis  本课程拟开设出面向全校社会科学和管理学专业研究生层次的大数据分析应用型课程。课程内容将横跨社会科学和数据科学两个研究领域，涵盖政治学、社会学、管理学、统计学、数据科学等多个学科的理论知识和实用技术。课程目的在于提高大数据时代学生的数据应用意识、建立数据思维、了解前沿方法，以及掌握有关数据采集、处理、分析和解释的基本原理和方法。课程将结合公共管理、司法开放、政治传播、社会治理等政务大数据应用的实际案例，提升学生对大数据方法的应用能力，为学生将大数据方法应用于具体研究打下基础。</description>

      <description>People do not merely respond to the outside world; they recognize, process, and make choices. I am interested in how this psychological process is achieved within media interactions among the sender, carrier, and receiver. This also makes my research different from the prevalent political-communication studies that focus on the content and means of the media. Instead, I focus more on how people respond to them, for instance, what the audience actually feels, understands, and does when they are exposed to a political message from the government.</description>

      <guid>/project/polilingua/</guid>
      <description>Language is the fundamental feature of human beings. The debate of whether does language shapes thoughts or the other way around has inspires the greatest theorists and scientists throughout the human history. Nevertheless, the importance of language in political lives has not been well studied yet.
Cutting in from an empirical angle, I strive to identify the influences of linguistic relativity and language planning in the government-mass relationship and the (re)construction of mass political cognition.</description>

      <guid>/project/poliresponse/</guid>
      <description>Disproportionate scholarly attention in the studies of the government-mass relationship focused on the government&amp;rsquo;s responses (motivations and means) to public demands. Less research explores what happens next. However, in real politics, the governments often fall into the curse that what they do mismatches what the public wants. I unbox this puzzle by investigating how the public responds to the government&amp;rsquo;s response. Several focused questions include: what do the masses learn from the government&amp;rsquo;s decisions and actions?</description>

      <guid>/project/inequality/</guid>
      <description>Socioeconomic inequality includes systematic discrepancies among citizens in income, assets, mobility, accessible resources, etc. I am interested in this structural property&amp;rsquo;s effects, paths, and mechanisms on individual and group political decisions and behaviors. In particular, how do people recognize inequality (what aspects of inequality)? How does their awareness and understanding of inequality affect their political cognition, preferences, and decisions? Even more interestingly, what (or&amp;hellip;who) forms the masses&amp;rsquo; inequality perceptions?
